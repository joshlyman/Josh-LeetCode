# Simple Counting 

# Go through every cell on the grid and whenever you are at cell 1 (land cell), look for surrounding 
# (UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT) cells. A land cell without any surrounding land cell will have a perimeter 
# of 4. Subtract 1 for each surrounding land cell.

# When you are at cell 0 (water cell), you don't need to do anything. Just proceed to another cell.

# Time: O(mn), where m is the number of rows of the grid and n is the number of columns of the grid. 
# Since two for loops go through all the cells on the grid, for a two-dimensional grid of size mÃ—n, 
# the algorithm would have to check mnmn cells.

# Space:O(1)

# Better Counting 

# Approach 2 has the same time and space complexity as Approach 1. Even though they have the same time and 
# space complexities, Approach 2 is slightly more efficient than the Approach 1. Rather than checking 
# 4 surrounding neighbors, we only need to check two neighbors (LEFT and UP) in Approach 2.

# Since we are traversing the grid from left to right, and from top to bottom, for each land 
# cell we are currently at, we only need to check whether the LEFT and UP cells are land cells 
# with a slight modification on previous approach.

# As you go through each cell on the grid, treat all the land cells as having a perimeter of 4 and add that up to the accumulated result.
# If that land cell has a neighboring land cell, remove 2 sides (one from each land cell) which will be touching between these two cells.
# If your current land cell has a UP land cell, subtract 2 from your accumulated result.
# If your current land cell has a LEFT land cell, subtract 2 from your accumulated result.


# subtract 2 means border do not count

# only consider left and up because right and down always have permeter
