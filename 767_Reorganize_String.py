# heap 

# https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/discuss/492827/Python-Simple-heap-solution-with-detailed-explanation

# We build a frequency dict of the letters in the string. We push all the letters into a max heap together with their 
# -ve frequencies (max heap: high-freq letters are towards the top of the heap)
# We pop two letters at a time from the heap, add them to our result string, decrement their frequencies 
# and push them back into heap. Why do we have to pop two items/letters at a time you're wondering? 

# Because if we only pop one at a time, we will keep popping and pushing the same letter over and over 
# again if that letter has a freq greater than 1. Hence by popping two at time, adding them to result, 
# decrementing their freq and finally pushing them back into heap, we guranatee that we are always alternating 
# between letters.

# 1.
# Since we are always popping two items at a time, we will definitely run into an out of bounds error if we have an 
# odd number of unique items in the given string. To avoid this, we need to make sure our heap at least has 
# two items at any given time. We achive this by running our main logic inside a while len(heap) > 1 
# instead of a while heap

# 2.
# Again if the there is an odd number of unique letters in the string, there will be one last item/letter remaining in the heap when our 
# loop terminates. Hence we need to examine that last item:
# If the last item has a freq greater than 1: -> then return "" becasue we can't escape having the same letter repeated contigiously.
# else if the item has freq = 1, we pop it, add it to our result and we're done.
