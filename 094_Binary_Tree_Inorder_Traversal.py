# Time complexity : O(n). 

# To prove that the time complexity is O(n), the biggest problem lies in finding the time complexity of finding the predecessor nodes of all the nodes 
# in the binary tree. Intuitively, the complexity is O(nlogn), because to find the predecessor node for a single node related to the height of the tree. 
# But in fact, finding the predecessor nodes for all nodes only needs O(n) time. Because a binary Tree with n nodes has n-1nâˆ’1 edges, 
# the whole processing for each edges up to 2 times, one is to locate a node, and the other is to find the predecessor node. So the complexity is O(n).

# Space complexity : O(n). Arraylist of size n is used.
